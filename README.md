# Rate Your Roommate 

## Overview 
This application takes the user input to build a database of reviews for roommates. Using the information in the database, the user can then look for a new potential roommate based on reviews, stars, and geolocation. 

## Getting Started 
To host locally, the user needs to 
1. Install node with express and handlesbars. 
2. Install mysql and sequelize. 

To launch the app on Heroku, 
1. Create an account. 
2. Create a user profile with information and image. 
3. Search for a person using either their name or email. If searching for a name, all users with that name will populate. Emails should only give the user the unique email. 
4. Click on either Leave Review or Read Review. Leave Review will take the user to a page that the user can select the number of stars to give to the searched person along with a written review. Both need to be entered. 
5. After clicking on submit, the user will be brought back to the searched page. If the user clicks on the Read Review section, the review will show there.
